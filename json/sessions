For many query, this is not the best way to optimize them: you need to rethink and rewrite them completely. To do this, you need to know how optimizer and executor work, and keep that in mind while composing your queries. In this talk, I will present an overview of a few less known and rarely used techniques such as:</span><span style=\"\">* using and implementing loose index scan for different scenarios;</span><span style=\"\">* using IOS in situation where it isn't applicable directly;</span><span style=\"\">* replacing IN (long list of values) with JOIN VALUES ();</span><span style=\"\">* moving a limit or offset clause inside joins;</span><span style=\"\">* and other tricks with row types and arrays of row types.</span><span style=\"\">Using these techniques and some other ideas, we will learn how to optimize a 'friends feed/subscription news' query, which is a typical task in many projects. We will diretcly compare performance of four different approaches: direct approach (simplest query), optimized direct approach (more complicated version of it), pl/pgsql with different algorithms, and implementation of this pl/plsql code in plain sql. I will show how this approach can convert almost any read-only non-dynamic (no EXECUTE statements and no exceptions) pl/pgsql code to a plain sql query.</span></p>",

With Kuo-Lien Huang, Ceasar Sun, Jazz Wang and Thomas Tsai, he developed another free software \"Clonezilla\", a cloning and imaging tool. He is the project leader of the file system imaging tool \u201cPartclone\u201d, and the maintainer of GParted live. The project DRBL won first place in 'Public Sector Applications' category at the Free Software Contest in France in 2007. He is the deputy division leader of software development technology division at NCHC now, and spends most of his time in the development of DRBL, Clonezilla and promoting the use of free software and high-performance computing.</span></p>",

Google and Government of India initially started a contest to crowd source the features and design of the appOur team won the contest in the end and were to make the official app for the PMO. I was the lead Android developer of the team. I will be talking about how we worked with the government and will talk about five aspects of the app - Development, scalability, security, release and maintenance. I will talk about localization of apps as our app is currently targeting 10 regional languages in India with dynamic content. We had to get multiple security clearances from different government and private agencies due to the nature of the app which included automated source code testing, white boxtesting, blackbox testing and manual testing. Due to the expected high load on the app, we did multiple load tests on the app before launch to configure servers and load balancers. Finally I will talk about the release process of the app and the ongoing maintenance.Contest Details -\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details</a> about the release -\u00a0<a href=\"https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1</a></p>",

It can be seen as an extension of NLTK, but with special consideration for the unique needs of historical languages. It provides basic functions for many languages (e.g., n-grams, word frequencies, word tokenization) and wider support for several languages (Greek and Latin) that includes text normalization, sentence tokenizer, POS tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). We plan to extend to other languages, as well.</span><span style=\"\">The CLTK Archive is a website I worked on during my GSoC project. It's a web app front-end to the CLTK core and also provides a modern reading environment for interacting with ancient texts. The Archive aims to provide an aesthetically-pleasing yet utilitarian environment that facilitates reading, note taking, and learning. It presents Classical texts in an easy-to-read layout with metadata like translation, commentary, and word definitions. The site is backed up by a Flask based REST API that provides access to text corpora and other functions of the core CLTK package.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">I will also be giving a short demos of the capabilities of the Python library and CLTK Archive website (available soon as an alpha release).</span></p>",
